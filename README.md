# python_turtle_crossing_road_game
This is a game project. A turtle is controlled by the player from
the computer keyboard to cross the road while a series of cars are running from
right to left on that road. The turtle hits the car and the game is over.
If it can get to the other side of the road, it will increase its level on
the board. Each time the board increases in level, the speed of the cars will
increase.
